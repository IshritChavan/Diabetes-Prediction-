# Diabetes Prediction System

This project uses a **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** to predict whether a patient is likely to have diabetes based on various medical attributes. The model is trained on the **Pima Indians Diabetes Database**, which contains important health metrics such as glucose levels, blood pressure, and BMI.

### Project Features:
- **Input Attributes:** (Given values based on the dataset)
  - Pregnancies (0 to 17)
  - Glucose Level (0 to 199)
  - Blood Pressure (0 to 122)
  - Skin Thickness (0 to 99)
  - Insulin Level (0 to 846)
  - Body Mass Index (BMI) (0 to 67.1)
  - Diabetes Pedigree Function (0.078 to 2.42)
  - Age (21 to 81)
  
- **Machine Learning Model:**
  - Trained using a **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**
  - Predicts whether the patient is likely to have diabetes
  - Utilizes standard scaling to normalize input features
  - Binary classification (Diabetic or Not Diabetic)

### How it Works:
1. The user enters their health attributes, including glucose levels, blood pressure, BMI, and more.
2. The system standardizes the input data using the scaler to fit within the trained modelâ€™s range.
3. The **SVM classifier** makes a prediction based on the input data and outputs whether the patient is diabetic or not.

### Example Use Case:
```python
input_data = (4, 110, 92, 0, 0, 37.6, 0.191, 30)  # Input data example
```

### Output:
```
The Patient is possibly Not Diabetic
```
